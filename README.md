Team Members (4): Ahmad Ibrahim, Jonathan Okushi, Jonathan Shekoni, Uche Onwukeme. 
Purpose: The purpose of this project was to provide users with a fun game-like application where they can express their creativity with clever wordplay and compelling storytelling. 
Tools Utilized:
    React (Front End), Vite (Front End), Figma (Front End), Python (Back End), Flask (Back End), AI as a support role (Front & Back End), Vercel (Hosting), Render (Hosting)
API's: OpenAI, Gemini, Herokuapp, ElevenLabs
Problems Encountered:
Problem: Experienced issues relating to resizing images on Figma. 
Solution: Instead of trying to make our front end design on Figma, we instead used Figma's other stylistic components to serve as a guide for how we could implement something similar using HTML and CSS 
Problem: Waiting for Gemini to generate the images for our web application caused the entire process to hang and lag.
Solution: We used parallel processing to generate and wait for the images, so that the rest of our applications functionality could run smoothly. 
Problem: One of our biggest problems was figuring out a way to host our website, specifically under the .tech domain. 
Solution: We realized for this issue, we were going to need the help of our hackathon expert organizers, and they provided us with the proper guidance advising us to utilize the Render and Vercel Platforms.
